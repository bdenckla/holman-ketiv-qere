# Correction" are the two labels where it has one.
# The messages from Chronicles onwards spell the same two lines "Target Text"

# current text and the suggested text next to each other. So the suggested text
# moves up to sit under the current one, and nothing else moves.

# Do not tidy this into a "sensible" order. A first pass also moved the
