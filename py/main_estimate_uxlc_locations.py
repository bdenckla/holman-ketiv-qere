"""What the sibling UXLC-utils clone says about each of Holman's atoms.

Run from repo root:
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe py/main_estimate_uxlc_locations.py

Two facts, both wanting ~11 MB of UXLC core XML this repo does not track, both
written out for the render step to read: where the atom sits in the Leningrad
Codex (data/uxlc_atom_locations.json) and what the UXLC numbers it
(data/uxlc_standard_atoms.json). The render step needs only what is tracked, so
a fresh clone can render the page but not redo either -- the same division the
.eml ingest step already draws.

The estimator itself is MAM-basics' uxlc_misc.my_uxlc_location, vendored into
py/uxlc_misc/ and py/uxlc_lci/ by py/main_update_vendored_files.py. It takes a
(book, chapter, verse, atom) quad, so no word matching is involved and none of
the CLI's ambiguity cases arise.

What it does NOT take is the atom number CaseRef holds, and until 2026-08-12 it
was handed exactly that. Three numberings are in play here and no two of them
agree everywhere; ``python_modules.uxlc_standard_atoms`` sets out the evidence
for what each is:

  * **Holman's**, which CaseRef holds, counts a ketiv/qere pair as one atom and
    does not count a mid-verse samekh.
  * **the UXLC's**, which this module works out and which the page shows, counts
    every child element of the verse.
  * **the estimator's**, which is whatever my_uxlc.read_all_books builds, that
    reader dropping the <k> and keeping every <q>. bibdist.calc walks its lists
    and takes the atom number as an index into one, so this is the numbering the
    estimator's input has to be in.

So _atom_numbers below resolves Holman's index to the verse element it names,
and reports that element's place in each of the other two counts. Of the 124
cases the estimator's number differs from Holman's on one, Ezekiel 8:6, whose
ketiv מהם has two qere atoms; before the fix the estimate for that case was
worked out for אֲשֶׁ֥ר, the atom before the בֵּֽית־ the case is about.

    27 lines per column, so the cut is right for a two-column Sifrei Emet leaf
    too, as long as the flat line stays on the leaf. What it cannot do is notice
    when the flat line runs off the bottom: on a Psalms page it would report a
    third column, which is not a column that page has.

    This replaces a guard that refused every Sifrei Emet case outright, on the
    ground that the three-column cut reported a column that was not there and
    reported it silently. Measured 2026-08-12 over the 63 Sifrei Emet cases in
    Holman's Psalms, Proverbs and Job messages, the largest flat line is 54.8
    (Job 34:20.4), so none of them reaches a third column; and the estimated
    column agrees with Holman's own stated column in 117 of the 124 cases, the
    seven that differ being split between prose books and the Sifrei Emet. So
    the failure that guard named is worth checking for rather than assuming,
    which is what this does.
