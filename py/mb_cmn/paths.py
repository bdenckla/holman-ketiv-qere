"""Single __file__-relative source of truth for repo-root paths.

See GitHub issue #75: this replaces both cwd-relative literals
(e.g. "../MAM-parsed") and scattered Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]
call sites, each of which encoded its own magic depth number. Every
sibling-repo path should be built by /-chaining off repo_root() or
repos_root() instead.

Cross-repo dependencies (MAM-parsed, MAM-simple, MAM-with-doc, MAM-OSIS, wlc-utils,
...) are by default looked up as siblings of this repo under a common parent
directory.  That convention breaks when the repo is checked out somewhere the
siblings are not co-located -- most notably a git worktree, whose root is nested
under ``.../.claude/worktrees/`` rather than next to the sibling repos.  This was not
hypothetical: until 2026-08-01 ``sibling_repo("MAM-parsed")`` in a MAM-basics worktree
resolved to ``.claude/worktrees/MAM-parsed``, a directory that has never existed.

To make sibling lookups overridable without changing default behavior, two kinds
of environment variable are honored, resolved per dependency in this order:

  1. per-repo ``REPO_<NAME>_DIR`` (NAME = the sibling dir name uppercased with
     each run of non-alphanumeric characters replaced by ``_``); else
  2. ``REPOS_ROOT`` joined with the sibling name; else
  3. ``repo_root().parent`` joined with the sibling name (the historical default).

With no environment variables set, resolution is byte-identical to the previous
``repo_root().parent / <name>`` behavior.

The override chain and ``require_sibling`` came from wlc-utils' ``repo_paths.py``,
which was written to fix exactly this and had it working while the module every
MAM-basics program imports stayed broken.  It is absorbed here rather than left in a
wlc-specific file, so one repo's fix is not a second copy of the other's bug.

THE LAYOUT ACCESSORS BELOW -- ``in_dir``, ``out_dir``, ``gh_pages_dir``,
``wlc_pages_dir``, ``novc_dir``, ``scans_dir`` -- and the sibling accessors at the end
of this module arrived from ``py/wlc_paths.py`` on 2026-08-12, when that module was
deleted (Phase 5 of ``doc/PLAN-evacuate-the-rest-of-wlc-utils.md``).  ``wlc_paths`` was
deliberately two-rooted: the code lived in MAM-basics and the corpus it read and wrote
lived in the sibling wlc-utils, so ``wlc_data_root()`` and ``repo_root()`` named
different directories and had to be kept apart by name.  Phase 3 copied that corpus in,
Phase 5 repointed every generator at it, and the two roots became one directory -- which
is why ``wlc_data_root()`` has no successor here.  Every former call site of it says
``repo_root()`` now.
