"""Resolve the UXLC-utils DATA root, and the subtrees this repo's code reads and writes.

THIS MODULE IS DELIBERATELY TWO-ROOTED, and that is the whole point of its
existence.  The code is here in MAM-basics; the corpus it reads and writes stayed
in the sibling UXLC-utils, along with the Pages site served out of it.  Every path
composed off the wrong root resolves silently into the wrong tree, so the two are
named apart:

  * the CODE root is ``mb_cmn.paths.repo_root()`` -- what ``py/`` is under, what
    ``repo_hygiene`` scans, what ``git`` and ``gh`` act on;
  * the DATA root is ``uxlc_data_root()`` below -- UXLC-utils' ``in/``, ``out/``,
    ``gh-pages/``, ``data/`` and gitignored ``.novc/``.

The two were named apart *before* the move, while the code still ran in
UXLC-utils and that repo's 214 tracked artifacts were an oracle that could prove
a path change harmless (Phase 1 of
``doc/PLAN-evacuate-python-from-UXLC-utils.md``).  The move itself then changed
exactly one line, the body of ``uxlc_data_root()``, because no other module
composes a data path off anything but this function.

What this replaces is cwd-relative string literals -- ``"in/UXLC-39"``,
``"gh-pages/clc"``, ``"out/UXLC-misc/all_changes.json"`` -- which resolved
correctly only while the process ran from UXLC-utils' root.  Two test modules
were already working around that, one of them by ``os.chdir``-ing to that root
before calling the library.

``mb_cmn.paths`` owns sibling-repo resolution and its ``REPO_<NAME>_DIR`` /
``REPOS_ROOT`` override chain; this module delegates rather than keeping a second
copy of it.
