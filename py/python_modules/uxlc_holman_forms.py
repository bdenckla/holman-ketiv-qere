"""The two forms Holman writes inside his prose, where he gives them no lines.

His Joshua, Judges and Samuel messages state the word twice on lines of its own,
``Current UXLC`` or ``Current Text`` and then ``Corrected Text``. His Exodus,
Leviticus and Deuteronomy messages do neither. There the form as it stands sits
in parentheses at the end of the ``Word / Verse`` line, after a reference the
card already carries in its heading, and the form he proposes sits in
parentheses at the end of his ``Suggested Correction`` sentence. Ben asked on
2026-08-11 that those cases read like the others, so the two forms are read out
here and shown as rows of their own.

Reading a form out of prose is a derivation, so every such case declares which
of three shapes its message has and a mismatch raises rather than being guessed
at:

  ``BOTH``                 the form as it stands in the first field, the
                           proposed form in the suggestion sentence.
  ``CURRENT_ONLY``         the form as it stands in the first field, and no
                           proposed form: the message asks only for a note.
  ``PAIR_IN_FIRST_FIELD``  both forms in the first field, ``current / proposed``,
                           with none in the suggestion sentence.

Nothing here is retyped. Each form is lifted from the message text as it was
parsed, and the parenthesised run it comes from must be the only one in its
field, so a hand-typed accent cannot creep in and a second parenthesis cannot be
silently picked between.
