"""Ben Denckla's corrections to Holman's wording, shown in square brackets.

The page quotes Holman's messages, so a word of his that is wrong stays wrong
unless something says otherwise. This is that something: a table of one-word
replacements, each applied where it is filed and shown bracketed, which is the
ordinary notation for an editor's word standing in a quotation. The page's
intro says whose the brackets are, because the notation alone does not.

Two entries so far, both from the Judges message of 7 August 2026:

  * Its subject says Joshua, and its one case is Judges 11:24. Holman had sent
    four Joshua cases four hours earlier and the subject line did not follow him
    to the next book.

  * Its Note says the munach is under the tet of אוֹתוֹ, a word whose letters are
    alef, vav, tav, vav. The mark is under the tav, which is what the change
    item the card links, 2026.04.10-7, calls it too.

Applying an entry is fail-fast in both directions. A replacement whose original
is not in the text exactly once raises, so a reworded message cannot leave a
correction silently unapplied; and a table key naming no case, no field, or no
message raises, so a mistyped key is loud. Between them, every entry here is
known to have fired.

The redaction marker ``[address removed]`` is bracketed too and is not one of
these: it stands where an address was, rather than replacing a word Holman
wrote. ``uxlc_email_extract.ADDRESS_REDACTION`` is that one.
