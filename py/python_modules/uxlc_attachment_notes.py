"""Attachments whose filename does not name the case they belong to.

Holman names an attachment after its case -- ``Josh 20.4.12 Daat Miqra.png`` --
and ``uxlc_email_extract._assign_images`` reads the case out of the filename. A
message with a single case may attach whatever it likes, because there is only
one case for an image to belong to. In a multi-case message a filename naming no
case, or naming a case the message does not write up, is an error rather than a
guess, and the two tables here are where such a filename is decided instead.

Both tables are keyed by the attachment filename as it arrives, and both raise
on an entry no message has, so a filename that changes is loud rather than
silently inert.
