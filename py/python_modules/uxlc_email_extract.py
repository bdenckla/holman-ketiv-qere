"""Daniel Holman's suggested-UXLC-correction emails, ingested and parsed.

Each message from Daniel Holman to Chris Kimball and Ben Denckla proposes
corrections to the UXLC. The body is a short preamble, a run of per-atom cases,
and a sign-off. A case is a heading line followed by ``Label: value`` lines; the
label vocabulary drifts from message to message (``Word / Verse`` in one,
``Current Text`` in another), so the labels are kept verbatim rather than
normalized, and the renderer shows the email's wording.

The heading drifts too. It is usually the reference, numbered or not, and in
the Chronicles, Jeremiah, Job and Ezra messages it carries the word as well,
parenthesised or after an em dash -- which in those messages is the only place
the form as it stands is written, there being no ``Current UXLC`` line. In the
Proverbs message it is a bare ordinal and the reference is in the ``Verse``
field. The Jeremiah message additionally divides its cases by book, with
``JEREMIAH`` and its three fellows alone on a line; see
``_without_section_dividers``.

Two steps, because this repo is public and a .eml file's headers carry the
correspondents' addresses:

  ``ingest_eml_files``  reads the .eml files from a local, untracked mailbox and
    writes the tracked derivative: one address-redacted body text and one small
    metadata JSON per message, plus each attached PNG. Run it when a new message
    arrives; it is the only step that needs the mailbox. Where a message has no
    plain-text part -- true of every message from Psalms Part I onwards -- that
    body text is read out of the HTML by ``_text_from_html``, there being no
    original plain text to prefer.

  ``read_emails``  reads that derivative. This is what the report is generated
    from, so a fresh clone can regenerate the page without the .eml files.

One thing is read out of a body rather than read off it: a Latin note letter
Holman's mail client embedded inside a Hebrew word, with the bidi controls that
carry it. See ``_without_embedded_note_letter``.

Parsing is deliberately fail-fast: an unrecognized field label, whether inside
a case or in the position that would have opened one, a heading whose reference
disagrees with its first field, an attachment that cannot be assigned to a
case, and a duplicate reference all raise rather than dropping content. What is
assumed rather than checked is that a field value is one line, and that the
prose after a message's last case is its sign-off.

What is NOT checked is that a case's atom index names the word the case quotes.
Measured 2026-08-12 against the UXLC core XML in the sibling UXLC-utils, 122 of
the 124 cases agree, and the two that do not differ only by a combining grapheme
joiner (Psalms 31:24.1 and Proverbs 30:15.1). Holman counts a ketiv/qere pair as
one atom, so the count his index is compared against has to do the same:
``uxlc_misc.my_uxlc.read_all_books`` instead drops the ``<k>`` and keeps every
``<q>``, which agrees with him wherever a pair is one of each and parts company
where it is not. Ezekiel 8:6 is the one case in the 124 where it is not -- that
verse's ketiv מהם has two qere atoms, מָ֣ה and הֵ֣ם -- and it was read as a real
disagreement until the numberings were worked out.

``CaseRef.atom`` is therefore Holman's and is left as he wrote it, which is what
makes it a stable key for everything filed against a case: his attachments are
named that way, and so are the tables in ``uxlc_change_records``,
``uxlc_holman_forms``, ``uxlc_attachment_notes`` and ``uxlc_comments``. It is
not the number a card shows. ``uxlc_standard_atoms`` holds that one, and sets
out the three numberings in play and how each was established.
