# table_data.json field guide

This document describes the fields in `docs-not-served/table_data.json` as produced by `py/main_extract_docx.py`.

It distinguishes between:

- extractor meaning: what the code is designed to produce
- current data observation: what is true in the present `table_data.json`

## Top-level object

### `source_document`

- Type: string
- Meaning: the path of the DOCX file that was extracted
- Source: the `docx_path` argument passed into the extractor
- Current data observation: a repo-relative path at repo top level

### `introduction_paragraph_count`

- Type: integer
- Meaning: the number of non-empty paragraphs collected before the first table in the DOCX body
- Source: paragraphs encountered before the extractor reaches the first `tbl` element
- Current data observation: `10`

### `table`

- Type: object
- Meaning: the extracted table payload

### `mam_plus_verify`

- Type: object
- Meaning: post-extraction verification summary against MAM-parsed-plus verse text
- Source: `py/python_modules/verify_table_words_in_mam_plus.py`
- Current data observation: all `77` rows are found in their mapped MPP verse text

### `mam_plus_rows_matching_mpp_verse_template_arg`

- Type: array of objects
- Meaning: rows whose `word` appears as an exact token inside at least one template argument in the mapped MPP verse
- Source: post-extraction verification scan of template arguments, with explicit exclusion of נוסח argument `2`
- Current data observation: `7` rows
- Row payload note: each row includes `template_args_in_mpp_verse`, an extracted list of template argument records for that MAM-plus verse (`template_name`, `argument_key`, `argument_text`) retained for traceable verification context.

## `table` object

### `header_labels`

- Type: array of strings
- Meaning: the literal text extracted from the header row cells
- Source: the first table row
- Current data observation: `['', 'Verse', 'Word', 'Finding', 'Aleppo', 'Leningrad', 'Notes']`
- Note: the first header cell is blank in the source document

### `column_keys`

- Type: array of strings
- Meaning: normalized keys derived from `header_labels`
- Source: each header label after lowercasing and slugifying non-alphanumeric characters to underscores
- Current data observation: `['entry', 'verse', 'word', 'finding', 'aleppo', 'leningrad', 'notes']`
- Note: because the first header label is blank, its normalized key falls back to `entry`
- Note: `entry`, `aleppo`, and `leningrad` remain source-column keys, but these text fields are intentionally omitted from each row object after extractor assertions

### `row_count`

- Type: integer
- Meaning: number of extracted data rows, excluding the header row
- Source: `len(rows)` after extraction
- Current data observation: `77`

### `finding_value_counts`

- Source: grouped count over extracted row `finding` values
- Current data observation: four entries

### `finding_value_counts[].finding`

- Type: string
- Meaning: one unique finding label
- Source: distinct values from `rows[].finding`

### `finding_value_counts[].count`

- Meaning: number of rows whose `finding` equals `finding_value_counts[].finding`
- Source: grouped count over `rows[].finding`

### `notes_structured_counts`

### `notes_structured_counts[].notes-UXLC-pointed-prefix-atoms`

- Type: string or null
- Meaning: abstracted leading pointed prefix atoms stripped from the UXLC ketiv token, with Hebrew runs replaced by `<HEB>`
- Source: parsed from the leading ketiv token only when one or more maqaf-terminated prefix atoms can be removed while leaving a ketiv letter skeleton that matches `rows[].word`
- Current data observation: `null` on most rows; `<HEB>` on 10 rows

### `notes_structured_counts[].notes-UXLC-yatir`

- Type: string or null
- Meaning: yatir marker extracted from UXLC notes, when present
- Source: optional trailing `\n(yatir ...)` parsed from UXLC notes payload

### `rows`

- Type: array of objects
- Meaning: the extracted row records
- Source: each non-header table row in document order
- Current data observation: `77` row objects

## Row object

### `row_number`

- Type: integer
- Meaning: the 1-based output row index
- Source: generated by the extractor while enumerating non-header rows
- Guarantee level: generated metadata
- Current data observation: runs from `1` to `77`

### `verse`

- Type: string
- Meaning: verse reference from the second table column
- Source: source-table content normalized to `pycmn/bib_locales.py` standard 39-book names
- Current data observation: values like `Joshua 3:4.5`

### `word`

- Type: string
- Meaning: the Hebrew word or form under discussion
- Source: source-table content
- Current data observation: populated with Hebrew strings

- Source: parsed from maqaf-terminated atoms at the start of the ketiv token when the remaining ketiv letters match `word`
- Current data observation: present on 10 rows
- Example: row `1Samuel 30:6.15` stores `notes-UXLC` as `בנו בָּנָ֣יו` and `notes-UXLC-pointed-prefix-atoms` as `עַל־`

### `notes-UXLC-yatir`

- Type: string or null
- Meaning: optional yatir marker parsed from the UXLC payload
- Source: parsed from a trailing newline marker in UXLC notes payload (for example `\n(yatir aleph)`)

### `notes-HaKeter`

- Current data observation: present on `2` rows (`Joshua 10:24.19` and `Isaiah 52:5.2`)

### `image_files`

### `image_files.leningrad`

- Type: array of strings
- Meaning: exported image paths for embedded images from the Leningrad cell
- Current data observation: one image path per row
- Path format: `gh-pages/img/rowNNN_leningrad_XX.ext`

## Short conclusions

- `row_number` is generated metadata.
- `entry` text is asserted to equal the string form of `row_number`, then omitted from row output.
- `finding_value_counts` summarizes each distinct `finding` label and its row count.
- `notes_structured_counts` summarizes `notes-UXLC`, `notes-UXLC-pointed-prefix-atoms`, `notes-UXLC-yatir`, and `notes-HaKeter` signatures with row counts.
- `verse_book_names` lists the distinct standard MAM 39-book names observed in `rows[].verse`.
- `aleppo` and `leningrad` text fields are dropped from `rows` after extractor assertions (`aleppo` must be empty; `leningrad` must be empty or a single `’` marker).
- Aleppo/Leningrad screenshots or embedded figures remain under `image_files`.
- `mam_plus_verify` summarizes post-extraction presence checks in plus verse text, excluding נוסח argument 2 documentation.
- `mam_plus_rows_matching_mpp_verse_template_arg` captures rows where the table `word` appears as a whole token in any template argument text, excluding נוסח argument `2`.
